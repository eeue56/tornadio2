=========
TornadIO2
=========

Forked and works with latest, version of Socket, Tornado and Python (3.3+). 
Very hacky. forked and "fixed" in a very short amount of time.

Does not work well or reliablly, and still has a lot of debug code in.

Expect a bad time if you try to use it in production. It will not work to the degree that it should.
